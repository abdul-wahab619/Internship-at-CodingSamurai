# Coding Samurai Internship Projects

During my internship at Coding Samurai, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects using React.js. In this repository, you will find three projects I developed: a Todo List, a Web Calculator, and a Blog Website. This README.md file will guide you through the process of running each of these projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run these projects, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started
